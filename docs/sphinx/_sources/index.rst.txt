Welcome to BioaPhy Analyses documentation!
============================================

The BiotaPhy Analyses repository contains various bio- and phylo- diversity
metrics for provided data.  These computations utilize Lifemapper objects so
that they can then be deployed in high-throughput environments such as a 
`Rocks Cluster <http://www.rocksclusters.org/>` or even an 
`XSEDE <https://www.xsede.org/>` resource such as 
`Comet <https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet>`.  At this time, analyses are
limited to those that can be calculated using Presence Absence Matrices (PAMs)
and Phylogenetic trees.
