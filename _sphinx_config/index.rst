Welcome to BiotaPhy Python Library documentation!
=================================================

The BiotaPhy Python repository contains various bio- and phylo- diversity
metrics for provided data.  These computations utilize Lifemapper objects so
that they can then be deployed in high-throughput environments such as a
`Rocks Cluster <http://www.rocksclusters.org/>`_ or even an
`XSEDE <https://www.xsede.org/>`_ resource such as
`Comet <https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet>`_.  At this time, analyses are
limited to those that can be calculated using Presence Absence Matrices (PAMs)
and Phylogenetic trees.
